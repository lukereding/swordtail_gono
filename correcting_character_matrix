I used [this](http://www.newocr.com/) image to text converter to convert the table as a png file to text.

There were many errors, however.

So I needed to do some substitutions.

I did simple find and replaces to replace O's with 0's, l's with 1's, etc.

The other major challenge was checking to make sure the number of dashes was the same as in the table. I usually had to add additional dashes.

I then had to add whitespace in between all the characters

I then replaced all `-` and `?` characters with `NA`
